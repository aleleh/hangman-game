Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman game! This classic word-guessing game challenges players to guess the computer-selected word one letter at a time. But beware, too many incorrect guesses and you might just hang the hangman!

How to Play
Start the Game:

Run the script to initiate the game.
Guess a Letter:

You'll be presented with a series of underscores representing the letters in the word.
Your task is to guess the letters in the word.
Enter a single letter to make a guess.
Feedback:

After each guess, the game will provide feedback.
If your guess is correct, the relevant underscore(s) will be replaced by the guessed letter.
If your guess is incorrect, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
Winning & Losing:

If you guess the word before the hangman figure is fully drawn, you win!
If the hangman figure is completed before you guess the word, you lose.
Upon winning or losing, the correct word will be revealed.

Rules
Only single-letter alphabetical guesses are allowed.
The game is case-insensitive; 'A' and 'a' are treated the same.
Repeated guesses of the same letter will not be penalized, but try to avoid them for the best experience.

Prerequisites
This game requires Python to be installed on your machine.
No additional libraries or modules are required beyond the standard Python libraries.
